# VCU_TEST_ECAD
Beaglebone breakout hardware for testing the VCU, and future continuous integration.

Work in progress.

See pinreference_bb_vcu.ods for which beaglebone GPIOs go where!
We also have a DAC to supply analogue signals to the sensors on VCU, reference also on above document.



THINGS TO DO:
- [ ] Does TLV5631 actually have SPI or is the datasheet blatantly lying to my face?
- [ ] Put correct CAN chips
- [ ] Confirm design with team
- [ ] Layout
- [ ] Start test software repo
- [ ] Better documentation for pins
